# project1-loan-defaults-analysis

## Introduction
Welcome to the Loan Defaults Analysis project! This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing loan default data. The goal of this project is to explore patterns and factors associated with loan defaults and develop a predictive model to forecast default risk.

## About the Author
- **Author:** Sabata Naolakgosi

## Project Overview
- **Data:** The dataset includes information about loan applicants, such as income, age, profession, and loan default status.
- **Analysis:** Exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques are used to uncover insights into the relationships between different features and loan defaults.
- **Modeling:** Machine learning models, such as logistic regression, are employed to predict the likelihood of loan defaults based on applicant characteristics.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision

## Repository Structure
- **Notebooks:** Contains google collab notebooks with code for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, modeling, and evaluation.
- **Data:** The dataset used in this analysis is not included in this repository due to its size. You can obtain the dataset from [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ps3Qbj1EOMl25UnEkDGlGzxuVre8uhPj/view?usp=drive_link]
